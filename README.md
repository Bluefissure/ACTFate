## About this Plugin
A simple plugin to scout the next dungoeon/trial/raid (instance to be generic) you are going to enter.<br>
*It works only on windows 10 and, for the moment, only with final fantasy in Borderless Windowed Mode.*<br>
If you find any bug or have any idea to share and optimize the plugin fill free to contact me or open an Issue (:

## Telegram and Pushbullet Support!
As of version 2.0.0, you can now set up Telegram and Pushbullet notifications directly from within DFAssist plugin settings!

## TTS Support!
As of version 1.4.1, Text to Speech has been added, and can be enabled from the plugin page inside ACT!

## Automatic ACT Updates!
Starting from version 1.3.11 DFAssist supports AutoUpdating directly from within ACT

### Why another rework?!?
It seems like **lalafellsleep** simply stopped the development, and using an external tool (like the one from **devunt**) seems a bit like an overkill...<br>
... We already use ACT for various things, so integrate this feature seems like a better option (:
 
### To-dos
- [x] Automatic Updates from within ACT
- [x] Remove unused support for Telegram
- [x] Remove unused support for FATEs
- [x] Handle Assembly resolve without locking dlls
